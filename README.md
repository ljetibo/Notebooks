Notebooks
=========

mix of python 3 and ipython notebooks practice and learning codes.
This is here mostly so I can remember fun bits and pieces of code.
Notebooks are sort of useful, view them on http://nbviewer.ipython.org/

##Compress folders
short code to compress folder tree structure recursively with 7zip. I.e. 

* Top 
  * Sub 1
    * Folder1
    * Folder2
    * ...
  * Sub2
    * Folder1
    * Folder2
    * ...

Outputs --> Sub1.zip, Sub1Folder1.zip... Sub2.zip, Sub2Folder1.zip under Top

##Dave's Bus
Poor Dave lost his briefcase on a bus. One of David Beazley's examples, find all route 22 Chicago busses using their API.
rt22.xml is the test file in case you misplace the links.

##idle.bat
remember that one time when you thought well what the hell Django and webapps can be fun?
This starts Python2.6 idle from within virtualenv Win7.

##InspectIt
Foolin' around with inspect module. Create a concise list of all classes, methods and functions of a module
and implement a source code returning function.

##ReadFileLines
That one time you thought this might come in handy within the ipython notebook inviroment
but haven't used it since. It's nice because it erases the lines it outputed so there's no clutter.

##TIDES
NOAA CO-OPS water level data plotting scripts.

##DUMP
Mostly ipython notebooks with matplotlib ploting stuff. 
Generally a dump for new ideas.
